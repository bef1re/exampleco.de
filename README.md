## exampleco.de
Hi early visitor!! This is going to be a *super quick* and *consistent* way to find code examples for any language and subject.

### The pillars
1. Every page should contain a quick and clear copyright-free code example
2. If there already is a qualitative source of example code for that language, point there. No reason to compete
3. Always link to the official documentation, as that is (for most languages) the best source of information
4. All pages will be in this git repository. Pull-requests are very welcome!
